# SALT2

The Spectral Adaptive Light-curve Template (SALT) fitter was introduced in [Guy et al. (2005)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...443..781G/abstract) and then updated in [Guy et al. (2007)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...466...11G/abstract)(SALT2). The latter has been used in several cosmological analyses with SNe Ia. Since then, there has been a few different versions, but we will use SALT2, which is still more commonly used today.

## SNCosmo

[SNCosmo](https://github.com/sncosmo/sncosmo) is a Python library for supernova cosmology analysis. It includes different SN models, such as SALT2. Hence, we will use this to fit with SALT2. However, note that it has many other functionalities.
